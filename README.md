CloudCamp 1 & 2 August
======================

This is my cloudcamp home work for day 1. Today we learn about basic cloud computing concept with how to create simple mobile app using html5 using SaaS.
We learn about codiqa.com and apigee.com that was new concept to me. 

What did i do?
=============
I tryied to create a simple mobile app according to our learning procces. I created a very simple app for wintel bangladesh limited.
It has four pages like- home, about, product, contact. Here all product informaiton is coming from apigee.com. Other pages contents are static.

apigee.com
==========
01) After login into apigee.com, added a collcetion it's called "wintels".
02) Then I added data field like-img, title, description according to json structure.
3) Then I retrieved data usign training rules.



Note
====
Remeber that It was created for mobile. So when you will download this code and open index.html file, you should customize your brower size like-mobile size.
This is my first small mobile app. So don't mind If you see some problems.
