We learn about codiqa.com and apigee.com that was new concept to me.

=============
I tryied to create a simple mobile app according to our learning procces. I created a very simple app for wintel bangladesh limited.
It has four pages like- home, about, product, contact. Here all product informaiton is coming from apigee.com. Other pages contents are static.

codiqa.com
==========
It was a assm platform for building mobile apps using drag and drop elements. I'm really appreciate this sites.<br />
01) First I had to create a free account. <br />
02) Then I created a simple project.<br />
03) Then I designed my project using drag and drop elements. <br />
04) Then run and download this code into my computer local disk.

apigee.com
==========
01) After login into apigee.com, added a collcetion it's called "wintels".<br />
02) Then I added data field like-img, title, description according to json structure.<br />
3) Then I retrieved data usign training rules.



Note
====
Remeber that It was created for mobile. So when you will download this code and open index.html file, you should customize your brower size like-mobile size.
This is my first small mobile app. So don't mind If you see some problems.
